This project works with Yelp dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/shikhar42/yelps-dataset) to create a data driven information system.
It uses Spring-boot along along with MariaDB Cluster for the phase 1.
For phase 2, NoSQL Database will be used.

My aim is to build a system that remains DB agnostic except for the data layer, and work effictively for both relational and non-realtional database cluster.
